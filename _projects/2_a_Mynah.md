The Mynah is an amateur solid-fueled fin-stabilized rocket developed by a group of students from 3 Singaporean universities: NTU, NUS and SUTD.

I was personally involved in 2023 after joining the SEDS (Students for the Exploration and Development of Space) chapter in SUTD, and joined the Avionics subgroup to work on the design, implementation and fabrication of the altimeter, parachute deployment and telemetry subsystems.

This rocket joined the Friends of Amateur Rocketry (FAR) 2023 competition and was successfully launched to the target altitude of 3.2km, clinching the 3rd place in the competition.

While I was not able to physically attend the launch due to other personal commitments, it was a great experience building the avionics of an actual rocket that flew!

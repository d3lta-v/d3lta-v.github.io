EVAM 1.0 is the flagship project of the Electric Vehicle club in SUTD, which aims to build a completely functional, full scale electric vehicle for motorsports, education and skills training.

I was involved in the project at the start of 2024 to assist in the development of a new low-voltage electrical system based on the CAN standard, and to improve reliability of the existing connectors, which previously used screw terminals. 

The circuit boards were designed to use the industry-standard M12 circular connectors utilizing the CiA 106 standard for pinout, and the original software was partially rewritten to accommodate the new design and bugs were fixed in the process.
